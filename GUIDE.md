   - Download from: nodejs.org
   - Just like a car needs an engine to run, your project needs Node.js!

2. **Code Editor** - Like a word processor, but for code
   - We recommend VS Code
   - It's like Microsoft Word, but for programming

3. **Web Browser** - Your window to view your creation
   - Chrome or Firefox recommended

## Step-by-Step Tutorial (With Pictures! 📸)

### 1. Setting Up Your Project

```
Your Project Structure
📁 Project Root
├── 📁 src (Your source code - like a kitchen)
│   ├── 📁 components (Ingredients)
│   ├── 📁 styles (Recipe book)
│   └── 📄 main.tsx (Main recipe)
└── 📁 public (Ready-to-serve dishes)
```

### 2. Making Your First Change

Before:
```jsx
<Button>Old Button</Button>
```

After:
```jsx
<Button className="button-gradient">
  ✨ Beautiful Button ✨
</Button>
```

See how easy that was? 🌟

### 3. Understanding the Building Blocks

Think of components like building blocks:
```

🟨 Hero       - Your home's entrance
🟩 Features   - The rooms
🟪 Footer     - The foundation
```
